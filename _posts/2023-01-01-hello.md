# AWS Pentester/Red Team Methodology

When performing an audit or vulnerability assessment of an AWS environment, it is crucial to understand the services being used, what is publicly accessible, who has access to what resources, and the connections between internal and external services. From the perspective of a group attempting to infiltrate and compromise the environment, the initial step would be to acquire valid credentials. Here are some ways to find that,

- Leaks on Internet (OSINT)
- Social Engineering
- Password Leaks/Reuse
- Vulnerabilities in AWS-Hosted Applications
- 3rd parties breached
- Internal Employees
- Cognito Credentials

## Four main areas to concentrate on while performing Penetration Testing
- External Infrastructure of your AWS cloud
- Applications you are hosting/building on your platform
- Internal Infrastructure of your AWS cloud
- AWS configuration review

## AWS Pentesting Limitation (Legal Restriction)
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers
- Other companies’ physical hardware, facilities, or underlying infrastructure that belongs to AWS EC2
- Amazon’s Relational Database Service (RDS)
- Other suppliers manage security appliances

## AWS Services Enumeration, Exploitation and Privilege Escalation

The AWS platform offers a vast array of services, and this repo contains provides basic information, enumeration checklists, tips on privilege escalation, gaining persistence, and other techniques for post-exploitation on some of these services.
Manual Enumeration is not only the way to perform those pentest and audit, there are also variety of tools which can be used to automate the process, which will be discussed below shortly.
